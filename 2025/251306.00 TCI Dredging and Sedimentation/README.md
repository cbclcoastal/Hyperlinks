# Assessment of Dredging and Sediment Removal Impacts in Turks and Caicos Islands

## 📖 Project Background
The **Turks and Caicos Government (TCIG)** plays a key role in maintaining navigable waterways across the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). In recent years, dredging has occurred at several sites including **Providenciales**, the **Leeward Islands**, and **North Caicos**.  

Associated activities such as the sale, deposition, and placement of dredge materials (sand, quarry) have significant **shoreline, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural impacts**.  

Development permissions for dredging are often issued on an ad-hoc basis to:
- Maintain or develop waterways
- Connect regions for navigation
- Support economic activities

While dredging removes sediment from navigation channels, it also:
- Interrupts natural sand movement along littoral cells
- Contributes to downdrift beach erosion
- Increases turbidity and smothers habitats during spoil disposal

Recognizing these risks, the **Department of Environment and Coastal Resources (DECR)** initiated a comprehensive study to investigate dredging and sediment removal impacts on the coastlines of **Providenciales** and the **Leeward Islands**.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objective is to understand the **potential impacts of dredging** on:
- **Coastline stability** and sediment budgets
- **Environmental health** (water quality, habitats)
- **Socioeconomic conditions** (livelihoods, tourism, cultural values)

### Key Tasks
- Conduct a comprehensive study of dredging and sand removal impacts on sediment budgets and downdrift erosion.
- Investigate environmental impacts on water quality and habitats using existing data and desktop studies.
- Identify socioeconomic risks associated with dredging and sand removal.
- Propose mitigation approaches to reduce risks and impacts.
