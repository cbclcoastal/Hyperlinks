# TCID Dredging and Sedimentation Project

A scientific computing and coastal engineering project focused on modeling dredging impacts, sediment transport, and water level changes for the TCID region. This repository contains workflows, scripts, and documentation to support environmental modeling, stakeholder communication, and coastal protection planning.

## 🌊 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Assess dredging and sedimentation dynamics in the TCID coastal zone.
- **Scope:** Cyclone track analysis, wind field conversion, water level simulation, and sediment transport modeling.
- **Stakeholders:** Coastal engineers, environmental scientists, and local authorities.
